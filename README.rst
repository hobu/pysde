PySDE: SWIG Python Bindings for the ArcSDE C API
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was a 2.0 attempt at a project for manipulating ArcSDE's C API directly 
with Python. What's here is an unfinished attempt at a proper SWIG bindings 
for the API modeled on GDAL's SWIG bindings layout. I'm pretty sure nothing 
really works, but it should be a good starting point for someone looking to 
make it happen.
